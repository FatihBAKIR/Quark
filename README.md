Quark Framework
==

Quark is a framework focused on role playing game development.

It is highly modular and designed for reusability. 

The core itself is tiny, while providing the main functionality of Quark, it does not include any content. If you are new to the concept, you should also pull some quark packages. This [recommended package][1] contains some demos and useful examples.

Documentation is under construction.
